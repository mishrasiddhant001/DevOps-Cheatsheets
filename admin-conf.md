# Nginx Configuration for `admin.com`

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Nginx configuration server. The configuration is designed to serve a web application with PHP support, enforce HTTPS for secure communication, and include access to phpMyAdmin. It consists of two `server` blocks: one for redirecting HTTP traffic to HTTPS and another for handling HTTPS requests.

## Overview

The configuration includes two main `server` blocks:
- **HTTP Server Block**: Listens on port 80 and redirects all traffic to HTTPS, ensuring secure communication.
- **HTTPS Server Block**: Listens on port 443, serves the web application from `/var/www/html/MurMur/public`, processes PHP files via FastCGI, and provides access to phpMyAdmin.

This setup ensures that all traffic is encrypted and provides a secure environment for hosting the application.

## HTTP to HTTPS Redirect

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name admin.com;

    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

### Explanation
- **`listen 80`**: Configures the server to listen on port 80, the standard port for HTTP traffic.
- **`server_name admin.com`**: Specifies that this block applies to requests for the domain `admin.com`.
- **`return 301 https://$host$request_uri`**: Issues a 301 (permanent) redirect to the HTTPS version of the requested URL. The `$host` variable preserves the domain name, and `$request_uri` appends the original request path and query string. This enforces HTTPS for all traffic.

---

## HTTPS Server Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name admin.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem;

    root /var/www/html/MurMur/public;
    index index.php;

    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;  # Adjust based on PHP version
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

    location /phpmyadmin {
        alias /usr/share/phpmyadmin;
        index index.php;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /phpmyadmin/index.php;
    }
}
```

### SSL/TLS Settings
- **`listen 443 ssl`**: Configures the server to listen on port 443 (standard HTTPS port) with SSL enabled for encryption.
- **`ssl_certificate /path/to/fullchain.pem`**: Specifies the path to the SSL certificate file, which includes the server certificate and any intermediate certificates (full chain).
- **`ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.pem`**: Specifies the path to the private key corresponding to the certificate. These settings enable secure HTTPS connections.

### Document Root and Index Files
- **`root /var/www/html/MurMur/public`**: Sets the document root to `/var/www/html/MurMur/public`, where the web application’s public files are stored.
- **`index index.php`**: Defines `index.php` as the default file to serve when a directory is requested, typical for PHP-based applications.

### Included Snippets
- **`include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf`**: Imports a configuration file with settings for processing PHP requests via FastCGI, streamlining PHP handling.
- **`include snippets/ssl-params.conf`**: Imports additional SSL/TLS settings (e.g., cipher suites, protocols) to enhance security beyond the basic certificate configuration.

## Location Blocks

### Root Location (`/`): Handling General Requests
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```
- **Purpose**: Manages requests to the root URL and its subdirectories.
- **`try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string`**: Attempts to serve:
  1. The exact file matching the request URI (`$uri`).
  2. A directory matching the URI (`$uri/`).
  3. If neither is found, passes the request to `index.php` with the original query string (`$query_string`). This is a common setup for PHP applications using a front controller pattern.

### PHP Files Location (`~ \.php$`): Processing PHP Requests
```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;  # Adjust based on PHP version
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
}
```
- **Purpose**: Handles requests for files ending in `.php`.
- **`include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf`**: Reuses the FastCGI settings for PHP processing.
- **`fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock`**: Forwards PHP requests to the PHP-FPM service via a Unix socket (adjust the socket path based on the installed PHP version, e.g., `php8.0-fpm.sock`).
- **`fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name`**: Specifies the full path to the PHP script to execute, ensuring PHP-FPM processes the correct file.

### Deny .ht Files Location (`~ /\.ht`): Enhancing Security
```nginx
location ~ /\.ht {
    deny all;
}
```
- **Purpose**: Prevents access to files starting with `.ht` (e.g., `.htaccess`, `.htpasswd`), which are typically Apache configuration files.
- **`deny all`**: Blocks all requests to these files, enhancing security on an Nginx server where such files are irrelevant.

### phpMyAdmin Location (`/phpmyadmin`): Accessing phpMyAdmin
```nginx
location /phpmyadmin {
    alias /usr/share/phpmyadmin;
    index index.php;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /phpmyadmin/index.php;
}
```
- **Purpose**: Provides access to phpMyAdmin, a web-based database management tool, at the `/phpmyadmin` URL.
- **`alias /usr/share/phpmyadmin`**: Maps requests to the phpMyAdmin installation directory (adjust the path if phpMyAdmin is installed elsewhere).
- **`index index.php`**: Sets `index.php` as the default file for the `/phpmyadmin` directory.
- **`try_files $uri $uri/ /phpmyadmin/index.php`**: Attempts to serve the requested file or directory, falling back to `index.php` within phpMyAdmin if not found.

---

## Additional Notes
- **SSL Paths**: Replace `/path/to/fullchain.pem` and `/path/to/privkey.pem` with the actual paths to your SSL certificate and key files.
- **PHP Version**: Adjust the `fastcgi_pass` socket (e.g., `php7.4-fpm.sock`) to match your installed PHP-FPM version.
- **phpMyAdmin Path**: Verify that `/usr/share/phpmyadmin` matches your server’s phpMyAdmin installation directory; adjust if necessary.
- **Security Enhancements**: For production, consider adding:
  - IP whitelisting or basic authentication for `/phpmyadmin` to restrict access.
  - Updated SSL parameters in `snippets/ssl-params.conf` to enforce modern security standards.

This configuration ensures that `admin.com` securely serves a PHP-based web application over HTTPS, with proper PHP processing and access to phpMyAdmin for database administration.
